# JAMIA-Submission

This repository was created specifically for the submission of our manuscript to JAMIA. This includes two files: 

1. ModelPreprocessing.py - this file contains the preprocessing steps that we used prior to training and validating the model
2. ModelTrainValTest.py - this file contains the steps that we used to split, train, validate, and test the model. Text that has been commented out also includes hyperoptimization steps, feature importance analysis, and exporting our model to joblib

This repository does NOT include the original data used as we did not want to make that public
